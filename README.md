# TekkenNotationMaker

Currently live at https://frostemanneogard.github.io/TekkenNotationMaker/

This is a frontend application to generate images of combo notation for the TEKKEN series of games.

## How to use
1. Select from the variety of themes from the "Theme" dropdown.
2. Click the button icons to begin building your combo.
3. Once satisfied with your output, press the big green button to download an image of your notation.

## Notes
This app features multi-language support. There is currently support for English, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Polish. These translations have been provided by community members.

If you wish to render the image at a different quality, then you can do so using the "Quality" dropdown. This will affect the final resolution of the image.

If you realize you've made a mistake earlier on in your notation, you can navigate using the orange arrow buttons and remove an icon with the yellow backspace button, or insert more icons at the cursor's position.

## Thanks
Massive thanks to everyone from the community who have reached out to express their gratitude for this project. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive from such a large part of the community and I can't express how happy that makes me.

This was just meant to be a dumb project I made at 1 am to help a friend out with a video idea since the [TekinputGenerator](https://github.com/spironan/TekinputGenerator) project is outdated. I'm glad it turned into something slightly larger than that and that it has become a tool which gets put to good use.

Just for fun, here's the message which led to the creation of this project:
![Discord message in swedish from "Flower" saying: "What do you think is the easiest way to extract Tekkens icons for things like screw etc.?"](https://github.com/FrostemanNeogard/TekkenNotationMaker/assets/77246706/4c69f657-9dce-4a2f-833e-f8d969e2ddfe)
